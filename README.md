# old-plataforms

## What is it?
It's a quite simple Java game I made when I was younger. I've lost the source code, so I had the decompile the executable. 
The game is but a collection of (possibly) colorful rectangles, which are the plataforms. The player is a square (whose color you can pick, thankfully), and your goal is just to jump over all the plataforms in order to get to the end of the level; there's nothing else to do. Actually, it comes with a level editor, and this makes things a bit more fun. 

## Important!
- This is a decompiled version which was uploaded here almost exactly as it was produced. Thus, it contains strange formatting and structures.
- The code itself also contains peculiar design decisions, but do remember this is very old and I was very young at the time. 
- There are no built-in levels, so the player has to create them by themself.
- Finally, there are a few tricks to achieve certain things, yet, as this game isn't relevant at all (and the source code is fully available), I see no point in providing a tutorial or something alike.
